            This structure is a comment block in html files.
            Everything in this structure is NOT considered part of any
            content on your web page.

            Most tag elements in html are done in pairs,
            these are called opening and closing pairs,
            there are some tags that are not in pairs and are reffered
            to as empty tags (aka void)
             The opening tag indicates the start of your element
              and the closing indicates the end of your element
             The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS 
              a slash(/) proceeding the name.

            The head area of your web page is NOT considered content.
            The tags within the head are used by the browser to manage
              some display of the page, give additional documentation
              to the page, indicate charactersets, help with search 
              engines, and many other assists.

     <!--
          This is the coding block for your content in a paragragh
          The paragragh tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
          A "block" group tag places your content on a new line

          You can place all of your paragragh text content on one
          physical line, however that would require a lot of scrolling
          right and left. 
          You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will not
          affect how the browser displays your paragraph content.
          You can place your content on seperate lines yourself and it
          will NOT affect how the browser displays your paragragh content.
     -->
     <p>The paragragh tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when 
        the content is displyed by your broswer. The browser does NOT 
        display your content in the physical style of how you have entered
        your code in html file.
     </p>
     <p>This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a 
        new line.
     </p>
     <p>Yay, a new line!(Testing the Go Live update feature.)</p>
